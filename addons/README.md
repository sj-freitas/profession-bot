# How to test the addons?

Copy the files to your WoW DIR, mine is:

cp -R "./Raidsort" "/Users/sfreitas/Applications/World of Warcraft/_classic_era_/Interface/AddOns"

## Raidsort

A World of Warcraft addon that allows you to copy a LUA table and use it as raid setup.
This makes group sorting and invite process incredibly trivial since it's not up to you to make these decisions unless you want to.
